# Haskell-To-Simple-Haskell-Translator

Official Website: https://rccookie.de/rwth/simplehaskell

A simple program (with a tiny built-in http server/website) that allows to transform (a subset of) Haskell-Programs into Simple-Haskell-Programs.
The simplification reports detail for each transformation step.

Because I can't be bothered to write or set up a proper Haskell parser, you have to enter the haskell code as AST (abstract syntax tree).
In Java, this simply means the haskell program gets constructed from objects.
On the website, you have to follow a relatively simply syntax, which is also explained there.
